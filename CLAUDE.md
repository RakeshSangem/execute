# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Execute is a web-based code playground (similar to CodePen/JSFiddle) built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate panes with live preview.

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Architecture

The application uses a split-pane interface with three code editors (HTML, CSS, JS) and a live preview iframe:

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time database and API)
- **Editor**: CodeMirror 6 with vim mode support
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + TailwindCSS)
- **Routing**: React Router for URL-based project sharing

### Key Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Main editor component with split panes and preview logic
- `src/main.tsx` - Routes and app entry point
- `convex/schema.ts` - Database schema (projects table)
- `convex/projects.ts` - CRUD operations for projects

### Data Flow
1. User edits code in CodeMirror editors
2. Changes are saved to Convex database (on Cmd/Ctrl+S or vim :w)
3. Preview iframe updates in real-time by combining HTML/CSS/JS
4. Projects are accessible via unique URLs (/:projectId)

## Important Implementation Details

- The preview is generated by creating a complete HTML document with user's code
- TailwindCSS can be optionally included in preview via checkbox
- Vim mode is enabled with custom :w command that saves the project
- Dark/light theme support with system preference detection
- Resizable panels using @radix-ui/react-resizable-panels

## TypeScript Configuration

The project uses TypeScript with strict mode and path aliases:
- `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- Separate tsconfig files for app and node environments
