# Execute

An editor that allows you to quickly bring your ideas to life right in your browser.

**Note:** This project is currently in alpha stage.

## Goal

The goal of this project is quite simple. _Execute_ allows you to quickly scaffold a vanilla html, css, js or React project with Tailwind CSS preconfigured in a single click. I'm aware of some of the alternatives out there. But here's the thing: they're slow. Slow as hell. One of the main goals of this editor is to be as fast as your computer allows.

If you're one of those wizards who wants to use Vim keys everywhere. Well, I've got you covered.

Got stuck? You'll be able to start a pair programming session with your friend with a single click.

Oh no!! You accidentally closed the browser window? Or your computer crashed because you use Windows? (Your pc ran into a problem :frowning_face: ...). No worries, _Execute_ will be smart enough to keep a backup of you code in you local machine.

Done implementing your ideas. You'll be able to export your app with all of the necessary files so you can continue working on it locally.

It's big undertaking I know. If you're skillful enough to make a contribution, feel free. Any contribution from docs to code to bug reports is appreciated.
